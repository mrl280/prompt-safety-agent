    "In this notebook we train and evaluate a simple baseline classifier for the problem of unsafe prompt detection. Based on our dataset exploration, we expect that n-grams, particularly unigrams, should be highly effective at distinguishing between safe and unsafe prompts. Leveraging this insight, we train a logistic regression model on the vectorized (TF-IDF) representations of the prompts. This model uses the presence and importance of n-grams to predict whether a prompt is safe or unsafe. Additionally, this method was recommended in the assignment description as a suitable baseline approach for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with this baseline to establish a simple, interpretable reference point for performance. By training a straightforward model like logistic regression on TF-IDF features, our goal is to understand how well basic text representations capture the distinction between safe and unsafe prompts. This baseline will give us a reference point against which we can compare the performance of more advanced techniques, such as LLM-based solutions."
